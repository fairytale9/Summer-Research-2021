Analysis and Detection of Violent Behavior in Children with Autism using Machine Learning


### Background
It is a project coorperating with a special education school in Hongkong. The students there are with autism and they often tend to take some violent actions which may harm themselves and other students around them. Our aim is to use machine learning to predict (at least detect) their violent behaviors. Thus, people can prevent these dangerous actions at the lowest cost of labor and time. 


### Data 
Sensor data from six different sensors. Surveillance video data. Facial expression data. Labels are done manully by the nurses. 
Note: Due to the privacy, the data I have access to are just sensor data. 


### File Explainment
Code_Model file contains codes related to the machine learning model including building the dataloader, training and testing the model.

Sample_Process_Data gives one sample how raw data is like and my codes to process them.
